Python code is provided to simulate the core/primary/secondary behaviour over time. It uses a lumped approach in which the point kinetics equations for the Molten
Salt are corrected via terms which simulate the entrance/exiting of the neutron precursors. The neutronics are based on 6 groups approach, and all state temperature variables 
are defined as mean averages of inlet and outlet temperature.
