Python code is provided to simulate the behavior of the core, primary, and secondary systems over time. It employs a lumped parameter approach, in which the point kinetics equations for the molten salt fast reactor are corrected with terms that account for the transport of delayed neutron precursors. The neutronics model is based on a six-group approach, and all state temperature variables are defined as the average of inlet and outlet temperatures.
